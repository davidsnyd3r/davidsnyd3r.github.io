    Let $$x = \sqrt{1+\sqrt{1+\sqrt{1+\sqrt{1+...}}}}$$
Define the sequence $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ 
\begin{align}
a_1 &= \sqrt{1} = 1\\
a_2 &= \sqrt{1+\sqrt{1}} = \sqrt{2}\\
a_3 &= \sqrt{1+\sqrt{1+\sqrt{1}}} = \sqrt{1+\sqrt{2}}\\
a_4 &= \sqrt{1+\sqrt{1+\sqrt{1+\sqrt{1}}}} = \sqrt{1+\sqrt{1+\sqrt{2}}}\\
\end{align}
The pattern continues and satisfies the recurrence relation 
$$a_n = \sqrt{1+a_{n-1}}, \forall n \geq 2$$
This begs the question, Does $x = \lim_{n\to\infty}a_n$ exist? If so, what is a closed form of x?

<header>Proof</header>
 We show that $a_n$ is increasing monotonically. 
 Let's proceed by induction<br></br>
 Base Case: $n = 1$ <br></br>
 $$a_1< a_2$$
 Induction step: 
 Assume the induction hypothesis holds $\forall n \leq k-1$. 
 $$a_{k+1} = \sqrt{1+ a_k}$$ $$a_{k} = \sqrt{1+a_{k-1}}$$ Since the square root function is montonically increasing and  $a_{k-1} < a_k$ by the induction hypothesis, it follows that $a_n$ is a monotonically increasing sequence.<br></br> We conclude the sequence is monotonically increasing $ \forall n \in \mathbb{N}$ by the Principle of Mathematical Induction.
 So the sequence is increasing monotonically, but how do we know it does not trail off to infinity? We claim the sequence is bounded by $2$
 We prove this by mathematical indcution.<br></br>
 Base case: $n=1$
 $$a_1 = 1 < 2$$
 Induction Step: <br></br>
 Assume the induction hypothesis holds $ \forall n \leq k-1$. $$a_{k} = \sqrt{1 + a_{k-1}} \leq \sqrt{1+2} = \sqrt{3} < \sqrt{4} = 2$$
 The induction hypothesis holds and we conclude that $a_n$ is bounded for all $n \in \mathbb{n}$. <br></br>
 By the Monotonic Convergence Theorem, limit exists.
 $$ x = \lim_{n\to\infty} a_{n+1} = \lim_{n\to\infty}\sqrt{1+a_{n}} = \sqrt{\lim_{n\to\infty} 1 + a_n} = \sqrt{1 + \lim_{n\to\infty}a_n } = \sqrt{1 + x} $$
 The reader is encouraged to stop at this point and ask what allowed for the interchange of the limit and the sqaure root function. Hint: think continuity. This yields:

 $$ x^2 - x - 1 = 0$$
 Solving gives two roots, $x_1 = \frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2}$ and $x_2 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$. Since $a_n$ is strictly positive, it follows that $$x = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$$ This limit is known as the "Golden Ratio".
